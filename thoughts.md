Does it make sense to have the library to eliminate hierarchy in favor of individual importable functions?
    - may ease maintenance
    - may ease lookup of functions since there is one place to look
    - can introduce the concept of function groups later

Maybe break into two separate packages
    - standard-node for node functionality
    - standard for functionality that can work in node and on the web
